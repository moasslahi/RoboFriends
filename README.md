# robofriends
This is my first projct on React
i learned about components and made an app the shows you cards of robots where you search and filter through them till you find a specifc card. i also made it responsive, for exmaple i have added a scroll component. As well as making the app look neat and beautiful.

- this is like facebook when you are trying to find a friend and your narrowing the search by filtering-

at the end i ran npn run build so it optimizes the folder for it to be ready for public.
